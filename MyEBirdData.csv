Generally brown wading bird about the size of a Mallard, with relatively short legs, round head, and a long straight bill that appeared characteristically ""angled down"".  White trailing edge to wings visible when bird flew briefly.  I originally identified this as a Common Snipe, but after talking to Barry MacMahon, I am not certain whether this was a Common Snipe or a Eurasian Woodcock.  The large size of the bird and the fact that Woodcocks have been seen on UCD campus before suggest that my original identification of Common Snipe might be wrong.  I got only a brief view of this bird, and so mis-identification is easily possible."
